## Contributing

When creating pull requests where you add commands, make sure they work with my commands system. In stead of the `@commands.command()` decorator, use `@commandExtra(category="my category")`. Always use the same category as the other commands in the file.

## Hidden Files/Directories

Yes, this repo does not contain all the files. See the `.gitignore` file to see what is hidden. I have my reasons for doing so. Only trusted people may gain access to these files upon request. They will be sent a copy which they can use to contribute to the bot.
